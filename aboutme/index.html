<h2> Ryker Tomchak</h2>
<p> My name is Ryker Tomchak and my major is computer science. I was born and raised in a small town in Idaho called Leadore. One of my favorite past times is riding my longboard around town. I also like going to country dancing on campus, I also am into hiking and exploring.  </p>
